    <h3>Faerie Dragon</h3>
    <img style="width: 500px;" src="/Faerie_Dragon.jpg" alt="modern update of card 'Faerie Dragon'"/>
    <p><em><small>
      This is a slight revision of the digital-only card Faerie Dragon from the 1997 computer game "Magic the Gathering" (also known as "Shandalar"), with modern design principles of randomness and fun in Magic. The main difference with this version is that most of the time, something good will happen to one of your creatures OR something bad will happen to an opponent's, whereas the original was much more wildly random in its outcomes. Additionally, the chance of an effect just changing a creature's color has been reduced to 10% (from the original 25%!)
