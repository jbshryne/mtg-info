      This is a slight redesign of the digital-only card Faerie Dragon from MicroProse's 1997 computer game <b>Magic: the Gathering</b> (also known as <b>"Shandalar"</b>), using modern design principles of randomness in Magic. The main difference here is that most of the time, something good will happen to one of your creatures OR something bad will happen to an opponent's, while the original was much more wildly random in its outcomes. The list of possible effects remains largely unchanged with minor tweaks, such as the chance of simply changing a creature's color being reduced from 25% to 10%.  (Note that "spellbooks" in Magic don't quite work like this, but it's the closest mechanic that exists, and I couldn't think up a better word.)
